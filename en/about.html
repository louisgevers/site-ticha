                        Shapes and shadows that reflect a body mass, subtly hiding the truth of whom we
                        really are. What we amass, acquire from each other, even from ourselves remains
                        fuzzy. The veiled truth in each one of us is like a mist of variable densities. The
                        human being is full of emotions which leads mankind to react in contradictory,
                        strangely and/or amazing ways.<br>
                        I seek to express this depth down truth using paper as a medium.
                        I appreciated working paper for its variety of textures; sometimes rough,
                        sometimes smooth but also for its solidity as well as for its weakness.<br>
                        Paper has a significant place in my art work. My experience working paper grants
                        me the right channel to bring to you a closer image of whom we are. Usually I give
                        the floor to the paper with engraving, oil paint and with wax sculptures.

                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p> 
                        I’m born in 1972 in Bruges - Belgium. When I was 8 my family chose to move
                        and live in the countryside, still not too far from the city.
                        In 1989, I entered a boarding school known for its well-established art section.
                        For 3 years I discovered the multiple pictorial mediums and developed intensively my
                        drawing skills.<br><br>
                        In 1992, I registered myself at the ESA 75 in Brussels and had the unique
                        opportunity to be teach by Boris Semenoff. Right away, I worked with oil painting
                        realizing my first faces and my silhouettes which mainly took the shape of larva.<br><br>
                        My glued-silhouettes were exhibit in 1994 during a collective exhibition at the
                        Gallery Viqueray. I chose to pursue the exhibition experiences with the Palmares
                        Renaissance, the Kunstogenblik, the Pascal Karp Gallery. One of my glued-silhouettes
                        was single out for the 45° Exhibitions Louis Schmidt in Brussels. Later on, my
                        silhouettes and set of heads were as well selected at the Mediatine in WSL. And in 2008
                        at the IPHP, in Poperinge.<br><br>
                        In 1995, I got my Bachelor degree of Arts in Painting and Engraving,
                        (honors: magna cum laude).<br>
                        In 2000, I was I invited to present my art work at the European Patent Office in
                        Munich. I exhibited paintings with frail animals illustrating our mankind’ animalistic
                        trait.<br><br>
                        I lived from 2000 to 2003 downtown Chicago. It was then, through the Art
                        Institute of Chicago, that I’ve met Susan Clinard who is a well-known and recognized
                        teacher in stone carving. Today still helps me in my actual wax sculpturing.<br><br>
                        In 2010 I was invited to exhibit my work at the INTA in Boston.<br><br>
                        Back in Belgium since I give drawing and painting classes to adults, as to children.
                        Those young pupils, through their natural freedom of spirit, gesture are great mentors for
                        artists such as me.<br>
                        At the same time, I continuously exhibit my work and use these opportunities to discuss
                        with different art lovers and some less art lovers the vision, the understanding, the
                        experience of Art. Day after day I experience those discussions, conversations, debates
                        as a fruitful source of inspiration. Inspiration that repetitively I use in my expression of
                        Art, in my interpretation(s) of the shapes and shadows that reflect a body mass, subtly
                        hiding the truth of whom we really are.
